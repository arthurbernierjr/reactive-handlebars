# reactive-handlebars
##### A miniature library to update handlebars templates reactively.

Handlebars is one of the most popular templating engines. Complicated UIs, data visualizations, and systems of calculations are examples of just a few problems where organising code becomes really hard while updating the templates on change.

### How can you simplify your templates ?
* Updating variables will update their values where used in DOM.
* Maximizing separation of concern and providing clean and declarative way of organizing the code.
* Observing the data passed to the template through observers. (If the listeners are set on object keys that are passed to the template).
* Abstraction over asynchronous HTTP calls by setting promises to the templates.
